Set up U-series disequilibrium correction for U-Pb geochronology

Description:

     The U-Pb method conventionally assumes initial secular equilibrium
     of all the intermediate daughters of the {}^{238}U-{}^{206}Pb and
     {}^{235}U-{}^{207}Pb decay chains.  Violation of this assumption
     may produce inaccurate results.  ‘diseq’ sets up initial
     disequilibrium parameters that are subsequently passed on to the
     ‘read.data’ function for incorporation in other functions.

Usage:

     diseq(
       U48 = list(x = 1, sx = 0, option = 0),
       
       ThU = list(x = 1, sx = 0, option = 0),
       RaU = list(x = 1, sx = 0, option = 0),
       PaU = list(x = 1, sx = 0, option = 0)
     )
     
Arguments:

     U48: a list containing three items (‘x’, ‘sx’ and ‘option’)
          specifying the {}^{234}U/{}^{238}U disequilibrium.

          If ‘option=0’, then ‘x’ and ‘sx’ are ignored and no
          disequilibrium correction is applied.

          If ‘option=1’, then ‘x’ contains the initial
          {}^{234}U/{}^{238}U ratio and ‘sx’ its standard error.

          If ‘option=2’, then ‘x’ contains the measured
          {}^{234}U/{}^{238}U ratio and ‘sx’ its standard error.

     ThU: a list containing three items (‘x’, ‘sx’ and ‘option’)
          specifying the {}^{230}Th/{}^{238}U disequilibrium.

          If ‘option=0’, then ‘x’ and ‘sx’ are ignored and no
          disequilibrium correction is applied.

          If ‘option=1’, then ‘x’ contains the initial
          {}^{230}Th/{}^{238}U ratio and ‘sx’ its standard error.

          If ‘option=2’, then ‘x’ contains the measured
          {}^{230}Th/{}^{238}U ratio and ‘sx’ its standard error.

          If ‘option=3’, then ‘x’ contains the measured Th/U ratio of
          the magma (assumed or determined from the whole rock or
          volcanic glass) and ‘sx’ its standard error. This only
          applies for Th-bearing U-Pb data formats 7 and 8.

     RaU: a list containing three items (‘x’, ‘sx’ and ‘option’)
          specifying the {}^{226}Ra/{}^{238}U disequilibrium.

          If ‘option=0’, then ‘x’ and ‘sx’ are ignored and no
          disequilibrium correction is applied.

          If ‘option=1’, then ‘x’ contains the initial
          {}^{226}Ra/{}^{238}U ratio and ‘sx’ its standard error.

     PaU: a list containing three items (‘x’, ‘sx’ and ‘option’)
          specifying the {}^{231}Pa/{}^{235}U disequilibrium.

          If ‘option=0’, then ‘x’ and ‘sx’ are ignored and no
          disequilibrium correction is applied.

          If ‘option=1’, then ‘x’ contains the initial
          {}^{231}Pa/{}^{235}U ratio and ‘sx’ its standard error.

Details:

     There are three ways to correct for the initial disequilibrium
     between the activity of {}^{238}U, {}^{234}Th, {}^{230}Th, and
     {}^{226}Ra; or between {}^{235}U and {}^{231}Pa:

       1. Specify the assumed initial activity ratios and calculate how
          much excess {}^{206}Pb and {}^{207}Pb these would have
          produced.

       2. Measure the current activity ratios to infer the initial
          ratios.  This approach only works for young samples.

       3. The initial {}^{230}Th/{}^{238}U activity ratio can also be
          estimated by providing the Th/U-ratio of the magma.

Value:

     a list with the following items:

     U48, ThU, RaU, PaU the same as the corresponding input arguments

     equilibrium a boolean flag indicating whether ‘option=TRUE’ and/or
          ‘x=1’ for all activity ratios

     Q the eigenvectors of the disequilibrium matrix exponential

     Qinv the inverse of ‘Q’

     L a named vector of all the relevant decay constants

     n0 the initial atomic abundances of all the parent and daughter
          isotopes (used by ‘mclean’)

Examples:

     d <- diseq(U48=list(x=0,option=1),ThU=list(x=2,option=1),
                RaU=list(x=2,option=1),PaU=list(x=2,option=1))
     fn <- system.file("diseq.csv",package="IsoplotR")
     UPb <- read.data(fn,method='U-Pb',format=2,d=d)
     concordia(UPb,type=2,show.age=1)
